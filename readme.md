# Day 5 of My 3 Weeks Game Challenge

This is the fifth day of my [3 weeks challenge](https://github.com/zsoltime/game-challenge).

Tower of Hanoi seemed to be an interesting choice. It's a math puzzle, consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. You need to move the whole first stack to any other rod, keeping the same conical shape.

Only one disk can be moved at a time and no disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

## User Stories

- [x] I can choose how many disks I want to play with
- [x] I can see how many moves it took to solve the game
- [x] I can see how long it took to solve the game
- [ ] I can hit the 'Solve' button and it shows me the solution

## Next Steps

Adding settings, like the number of rods is a must.
